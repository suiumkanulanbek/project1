            <h1>Rare Disease Treatment Is Costly—Delayed Diagnosis Makes It Even Worse</h1>
            <p class="subhead">In the US, rare disease diagnosis delay often takes around six years, leading patients to pay for ineffective treatments.</p>

        <p>The true cost of healthcare for people with rare diseases has long been underestimated. Recent research shows that their medical expenses are three to five times higher than those without a rare disease. These increased costs from frequent hospital visits, expensive treatments, specialized care, and prolonged diagnostic delays.</p>
        <p>Beyond direct medical expenses, rare disease patients and their families face significant indirect costs, including lost income, caregiver expenses, as well as out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance.</p>

        <p>A doctor of this reddit user who claimed<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1gx0sei/struggling_with_two_rare_diseases_and_denied/?share_id=cI2zhx5DB3SaiMGkSodxw&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=2">to have two rare conditions  Budd-Chiari syndrome and Polycythemia Vera suggested using medications that would significantly improve his condition, but his medical insurance company denied his coverage.</p>
       
        <p>Another user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1db8mlc/having_an_orphan_disease_is_so_unfair/?share_id=rrJQBKEsrIqxosg-8anxP&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1"></a>with a rare diagnosis in need of IVIG  has also been rejected coverage  by their insurance company. They claim they have been fighting  to get IVIG approved as part of their treatment, as it's their best chance at remission and could extend their life expectancy from 5-10 years to 30 years. IVIG meets all the necessary criteria for approval by insurance, but it will not be automatically approved due to one key requirement: it must be proven to consistently work across many cases. Unfortunately, there aren't enough patients in the U.S. to demonstrate this reliably to insurance companies, even though IVIG has shown positive results in extending life expectancy for refractory cases.

        <p>Reports show <a href="https://chiesirarediseases.com/assets/pdf/chiesiglobalrarediseases.whitepaper-feb.-2022_production-proof.pdf"></a> that treating people with rare diseases costs around 10 times more per patient each year than treating people with more common diseases. And those costs are, nearly 60% are covered by patients themselves, or their families. </p>
       
        <p>The same data <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004040/#_ad93_"></a>" shows that patients with rare diseases spend from $30000 to $60000 for medical and non-medical treatment costs. In most cases, non-medical costs are higher, and medical costs that are not covered by insurance companies can make up to hundreds of dollars a year, which patients have to pay themselves.

        <p>Besides the complications with insurance companies, patients with rare 
            diseases struggle with diagnosis delays. Data shows that on average,
            it takes around six years for them to get diagnosed. Consequently, 
            they suffer from both physical pain and efficient treatment costs. </p>

        <p>Researchers estimate that delayed diagnoses can rack up between $86,000 and 
            $517,000 in extra costs per patient, covering both medical and other expenses 
            in the years before diagnosis. However, these estimates do not include logistics 
            costs, as travel expenses and time.</p>
